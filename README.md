# TASK
I'm Ayan

I want to join WhiteHats to learn practical cybersecurity skills, work on real-world projects, and be part of a community that focuses on ethical hacking and security awareness.

Recently, I read about the Change Healthcare ransomware attack, where attackers disrupted healthcare payment systems across the United States. The incident showed how cyberattacks on critical infrastructure can affect millions of people and highlighted the importance of strong cybersecurity practices.
